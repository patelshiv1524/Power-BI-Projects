Harnessing the robust visualization capabilities of Power BI, this dashboard furnishes healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical entities, and policymakers with a potent instrument for informed decision-making grounded in data. My project primarily concentrated on discerning sales patterns and highlighting the highest and lowest performing products.

Key Insights from the Project:
• Developed an interactive dashboard for the meticulous tracking and analysis of medicine sales data.
• Employed intricate parameters to delve deeper into the data within worksheets, allowing for customization through filters and slicers.
• Established connections, integrated new tables, performed calculations to manipulate data, and facilitated user-driven parameters for visualizations.
• Utilized an array of customized visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, area charts, maps, and slicers, among others.
